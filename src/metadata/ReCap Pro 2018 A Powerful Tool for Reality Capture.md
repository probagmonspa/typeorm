If you want to try ReCap Pro 2018 for yourself, you can download a free trial version from the Autodesk website[^1^]. You can also watch a video demonstration of ReCap Pro 2018 on YouTube[^2^]. To find out the current version number of ReCap Pro 2018, you can check the forums.autodesk.com[^3^].
 
ReCap Pro 2018 is a powerful tool for reality capture that can help you create accurate and realistic 3D models of any environment. Whether you are an architect, engineer, contractor, surveyor, or hobbyist, ReCap Pro 2018 can help you streamline your workflow and enhance your design process.

In this article, we will show you how to use ReCap Pro 2018 to create a 3D model of a building from laser scans. You will need the following:

1. A computer with ReCap Pro 2018 installed.
2. A laser scanner that is compatible with ReCap Pro 2018.
3. A building that you want to scan and model.

The steps are as follows:

1. Set up your laser scanner and scan the building from different angles. Make sure to cover all the details and features of the building.
2. Transfer the scan data to your computer and open ReCap Pro 2018.
3. Create a new project and import the scan data. ReCap Pro 2018 will automatically register the scans and create a point cloud of the building.
4. Use the tools in ReCap Pro 2018 to clean, edit, and optimize the point cloud. You can remove unwanted points, crop, colorize, classify, and segment the point cloud.
5. Use the tools in ReCap Pro 2018 to measure, annotate, and export the point cloud. You can measure distances, areas, volumes, angles, and coordinates of the point cloud. You can also add notes, tags, regions, and hyperlinks to the point cloud. You can export the point cloud as RCP or RCS files for use in other Autodesk products or as E57 files for use in other applications.

By following these steps, you can create a 3D model of a building from laser scans using ReCap Pro 2018. You can use this model for various purposes such as design, analysis, visualization, simulation, and documentation. ReCap Pro 2018 is a powerful tool for reality capture that can help you capture and create 3D models of any environment.
